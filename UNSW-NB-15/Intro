The raw network packets of the UNSW-NB 15 dataset was created by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS) for generating a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviours.

Tcpdump tool is utilised to capture 100 GB of the raw traffic (e.g., Pcap files). This dataset has nine types of attacks, namely, Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode and Worms. The Argus, Bro-IDS tools are used and twelve algorithms are developed to generate totally 49 features with the class label.

These features are described in UNSW-NB15_features.csv file.

The total number of records is two million and 540,044 which are stored in the four CSV files, namely, UNSW-NB151.csv, UNSW-NB152.csv, UNSW-NB153.csv and UNSW-NB154.csv.

The ground truth table is named UNSW-NB15GT.csv and the list of event file is called UNSW-NB15LIST_EVENTS.csv.

A partition from this dataset is configured as a training set and testing set, namely, UNSWNB15training-set.csv and UNSWNB15testing-set.csv respectively.

The number of records in the training set is 175,341 records and the testing set is 82,332 records from the different types, attack and normal.Figure 1 and 2 show the testbed configuration dataset and the method of the feature creation of the UNSW-NB15, respectively.
